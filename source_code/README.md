## Source code
This folder contains the scripts develop for the processing and analysis of the data collected

**Programming language:** Python 2.7.18

## Scripts
- *Batch_cuckoo2pd.py* - Runs through all the report json file generated from each analysis performed using cuckoo and get the api calls inside processes. The output is a csv file with all the api calls, one per json file.

**Deep Learning**
- *Bi-Directional_LSTM* - Implement Bi-LSTM algorithm using Word2Vec for data processing.
- *GRU* - Implement GRU algorithm using Word2Vec for data processing.
- *LSTM* -Implement LSTM algorithm using Word2Vec for data processing.

**SVM**
- *csv_txt_in_ngrams* - Runs through all the csv created using the previous script and creates n-grams. The output is a txt file with all the n-grams of all csv together.
- *svm_multiclass* - Implements SVM for multiclass classification.

**Sequence pattern**
- *csv_txt_join_multiple_api_calls* - Runs through all the csv created using the first script and joins all the api calls separated by comma. The output is a txt file with all the csv api calls in one file. One line is created per file.
- *get_sequence_frequency* - Gets the sequences using Seq2Pat library. The input is the file generated using the previous script and the result is the sequences. The script removes subsequences contained in bigger sequences, receives min_frequency and the type (more frequent or less frequent)
- *signature_analysis* - Generates signatures given the sequence found in "get_sequence_frequence". Calculates predictions and performance metrics.
